# EEGLAB Tutorial  
**Last edited: May 2021**  

This is a demonstration of how to use EEGLAB with the public dataset **BCI Competition IV-2a**.  

## **Description**  
The **BCI Competition IV-2a dataset**, provided by the **Laboratory of Brain-Computer Interfaces** at **Graz University of Technology**, was used to evaluate the performance of the proposed framework.  

This dataset was collected from **nine right-handed subjects (A01-A09)** using a **22-channel Ag/AgCl electrode EEG system** at a **sampling rate of 250 Hz**. The dataset includes EEG recordings for **left and right-hand motor imagery (MI) tasks**, with **72 trials per task per subject**.
